# Render Deployment Fix

## Issue: SQLAlchemy + Python 3.13 Compatibility

Your Render deployment failed because SQLAlchemy 1.4.53 is not compatible with Python 3.13. The error shows:

```
AssertionError: Class <class 'sqlalchemy.sql.elements.SQLCoreOperations'> directly inherits TypingOnly but has additional attributes {'__firstlineno__', '__static_attributes__'}.
```

## Solution Applied

1. **Updated `render.yaml`**: Changed runtime from `python-3.11.9` to `python-3.12.7`
2. **Updated `runtime.txt`**: Set to `python-3.12.7`
3. **Updated `requirements.txt`**: Added missing dependencies for Supabase/PostgreSQL support

## Why This Happened

- Render was using Python 3.13.4 (newer than specified in render.yaml)
- SQLAlchemy 1.4.x doesn't support Python 3.13
- Python 3.12 is the latest version that works with your current SQLAlchemy version

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push these changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Render deployment: Use Python 3.12 for SQLAlchemy compatibility"
   git push
   ```

2. **Trigger a new deployment** on Render (it should auto-deploy)

3. **If you want to use Python 3.13+ in the future**, you'll need to:
   - Upgrade to SQLAlchemy 2.x (major version with breaking changes)
   - Update your model code accordingly
   - Test thoroughly before deploying

## Alternative: Upgrade to SQLAlchemy 2.x

If you want to use Python 3.13+, you can upgrade SQLAlchemy:

```bash
# In requirements.txt, change:
SQLAlchemy==1.4.53  # Remove this line
Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.5.1  # Keep this, it supports SQLAlchemy 2.x

# Add:
SQLAlchemy==2.0.23
```

But this requires code changes as SQLAlchemy 2.x has breaking changes.

## Verification

After deployment succeeds, test these endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Should return 200
- `GET /events` - Should return events data
- Database operations should work normally

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Render dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Supabase PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - A secure random string
- `SECRET_KEY` - Flask secret key
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Your frontend URL (e.g., https://your-app.vercel.app)
