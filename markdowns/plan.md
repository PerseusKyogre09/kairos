Develop and deploy basic smart contracts for event creation, ticket sales, and NFT minting. Implement essential functions for event management and participant verification on testnet.

### Phase 4: Backend API Development (Hours 8-12)
**Core Backend Services**
Build RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, event CRUD operations, AI matching logic, and blockchain integration middleware. Implement database models and establish secure communication protocols.

### Phase 5: Frontend Core Features (Hours 12-16)
**User Interface Implementation**
Develop responsive web interface with event discovery, user registration, profile management, and wallet connection. Create intuitive UI components for seamless user experience across desktop and mobile.

### Phase 6: AI Integration (Hours 16-18)
**AI-Powered Matching System**
Implement AI algorithms for participant matching, skill-based team formation, and personalized event recommendations. Integrate with backend API and optimize for real-time performance.

### Phase 7: AR/VR Demo Features (Hours 18-20)
**Immersive Experience Components**
Develop basic AR/VR features for virtual event spaces, participant interaction, and immersive networking. Create proof-of-concept demonstrations showcasing platform's cutting-edge capabilities.

### Phase 8: Integration & Testing (Hours 20-22)
**System Integration and Quality Assurance**
Connect all components, test end-to-end workflows, debug critical issues, and optimize performance. Conduct comprehensive testing of blockchain transactions, user flows, and AI matching accuracy.

### Phase 9: Demo Preparation (Hours 22-23)
